# gis_mapping_w3

 This is the second webpage that we've built for this course.
 Inspired from the earthquake that happened last week, I deceided to build a data visualization of how many earthquakes happen everyday near us. Turns out that USGS has a readily available database for global earthquake, availale in both .csv and geojson formats. And the rest is just inject them into Mapbox and decide on the final visual effects for the user interface.
